## Next Steps to Build APK

### Option 1: Build APK on Replit (Requires Android SDK)
The build failed because Android SDK is not available on Replit. You'll need to complete this on a local machine with Android development tools.

### Option 2: Build Locally (Recommended)
1. **Download your project** from Replit
2. **Install Android Studio** on your local machine
3. **Set up Android SDK** (automatically done by Android Studio)
4. **Build the APK**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

### Option 3: Use Capacitor Live Reload for Testing
For immediate testing, you can:
1. Keep your Replit server running (`npm run dev`)
2. Update `capacitor.config.ts` to point to your Replit URL:
   ```typescript
   server: {
     url: 'https://your-repl-name.replit.dev',
     cleartext: true
   }
   ```
3. Build and install on device with live reload

## APK File Location
Once built successfully, your APK will be located at:
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```
