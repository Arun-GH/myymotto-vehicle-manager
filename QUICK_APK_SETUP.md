# Quick APK Setup - Skip VoltBuilder Issues

## VoltBuilder Having Problems? Use These Alternatives:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Easiest - No Upload)
Your GitHub Actions workflow is already configured. Just push your code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Build APK"
git push origin main
```

Then:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Wait for build to complete (5-10 minutes)
4. Download APK from **Artifacts** section

### Option 2: Codemagic (Alternative Cloud Build)
1. Go to: https://codemagic.io
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Connect your repository
4. Select **React Native** → **Capacitor** project type
5. Configure build settings:
   - Platform: Android
   - Build type: APK
   - Build commands:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run build
     npx cap sync android
     ```
6. Start build and download APK

### Option 3: Local Android Studio (Windows)
Since you have Android Studio on Windows:

1. **Download android folder** from Replit to your computer
2. Open **Android Studio**
3. **File** → **Open** → Select the `android` folder
4. **Build** → **Generate Signed Bundle/APK** → **APK**
5. Build completes → Install APK on phone

### Option 4: Direct Capacitor Build
If you want to try building locally in Replit:

```bash
# Clean and prepare
cd android
rm -rf app/build build .gradle
cd ..

# Build web app
npm run build

# Sync Capacitor  
npx cap sync android

# Try to build (might work if Android SDK available)
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Recommended Path:
**Use GitHub Actions** - it's already set up and will work reliably without any upload issues or dependency problems.

Your APK will have:
- "Open" button after installation
- "MyyMotto" in app launcher  
- All vehicle management features
- Emergency contact sharing
- No "Hello Android" issues

The GitHub Actions method bypasses all VoltBuilder upload problems and builds your APK automatically.
